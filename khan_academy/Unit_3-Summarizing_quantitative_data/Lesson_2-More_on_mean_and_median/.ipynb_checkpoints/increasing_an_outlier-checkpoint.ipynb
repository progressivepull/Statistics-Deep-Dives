    "# 🎳 Bowling Scores Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Scenario\n",
    "- Four friends track their all-time highest bowling scores.  \n",
    "- Three scores are between **180–220**.  \n",
    "- Adam’s score was **250**, then increased to **290** after a new game.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Median Analysis\n",
    "- With **4 numbers**, the median is the **average of the middle two scores**.  \n",
    "- Middle scores are unaffected by Adam’s change (still between “?” and 220).  \n",
    "- ✅ **Median does not change**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Mean Analysis\n",
    "- Mean = (sum of all scores) ÷ 4.  \n",
    "- Adam’s score increased from 250 → 290 (+40).  \n",
    "- This raises the total sum by 40, so the mean increases.  \n",
    "- ✅ **Mean increases**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Final Outcome\n",
    "- **Median:** No change.  \n",
    "- **Mean:** Increases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Key Takeaway\n",
    "- **Median is resistant to outliers or changes at the extremes.**  \n",
    "- **Mean is sensitive to changes in values, especially large increases or decreases.**  \n",
    "- In this case: **Median stays the same, Mean goes up.**\n"
