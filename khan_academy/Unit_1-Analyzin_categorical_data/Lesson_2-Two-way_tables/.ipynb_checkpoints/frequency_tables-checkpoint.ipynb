    "## ✨ Why Relative Frequencies Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relative frequencies allow comparison across categories by normalizing totals to **1.00**.  \n",
    "- Even though SUVs and sports cars had different sample sizes, percentages show that **sports car drivers had a slightly higher accident rate (25% vs. 22%)**.  \n",
    "- This perspective highlights proportions rather than raw counts, making comparisons clearer.\n"
